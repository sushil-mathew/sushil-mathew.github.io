## About me
I am a PhD student on the Economics and Public Policy program at Imperial College London. My primary research interests are in development economics and applied econometrics, but I do find most economics research interesting.

## Projects
In Summer 2023, I worked as an intern at the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, where I worked on Chapter 2 of the [Transtition Report 2023-24](https://www.ebrd.com/news/publications/transition-report/transition-report-202324.html){:target="_blank"}. Here's a CEPR-VoxEU write-up summarizing our work on the [Geopolitics of the Green Transition](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/green-transition-and-geopolitical-tensions){:target="_blank"}.
